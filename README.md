## 🧠 Problem Statement

Develop a backend system to manage books in a library or bookstore.  
The system should allow:

- 📘 Adding new books
- 📖 Viewing all or individual book details
- ✏️ Updating book information
- ❌ Deleting books

This should be done in a RESTful manner, allowing external systems (like frontend apps) to interact with the data securely and efficiently.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

To solve this problem:

- Created a **Spring Boot** application with layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
- Defined a `Book` model mapped to a database table using **JPA (Hibernate)**.
- Implemented **CRUD endpoints** for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books.
- Used **ResponseEntity** and appropriate **HTTP status codes** for API responses.
- Used **MySQL** for persistent storage.
- Used **@RestController** and **@RequestMapping** to expose endpoints cleanly.
- Built and tested APIs with **Postman**.

## 🧪 Additional Notes

- CORS enabled with `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` for testing from frontend.
- Future enhancements could include:
  - Pagination and sorting
  - Validation using `@Valid`
  - DTO layer for request/response objects
  - Global Exception Handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
